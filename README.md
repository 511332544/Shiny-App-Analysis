# Instructions
The website mainly includes three parts:  variation analysis, enrichment analysis, and survival analysis

## 1. Variation Analysis

### Data

-   Upload a CSV file

Users can use the application in their own RNA-seq or microarray expression data, and download the results.  Built-in visualization tools include box plots, heatmaps and volcano plots.  Please download the sample data (expression and pheno files) provided to test the application.



## 2. Enrichment Analysis
### Data

-   Upload a CSV file
-   Choose `p-value`„ÄÅ`q-value` and `p-adjust` variables for enrichment analysis

Users can use the analyzer to perform KEGG and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses in their gene list matrix and download the results. Built-in visualization tools include DotPlot, Table, Barplot, Network






## 3. Survival Analysis

### Data

-   Upload a CSV file
-   Choose `time` and `event` variables for survival analysis

### Analysis Tools

#### 1. Non-Parametric Methods

##### 1.1 Table

Providing a summary table of estimates of survival probability and
cumulative hazard using either the **Kaplan-Meier** or
**Fleming-Harrington** methods. Check the box
`Show Confidence Interval?` to obtain two-sided 95% confidence intervals
(CI types: linear, log, log-log).

##### 1.2 Plot

Drawing **survival** and **cumulative hazard curves** for the data. Customize
your plots by adding risk tables or number of censored subjects
barplot. You can draw stratified curves by selecting either a discrete
variable or a continuous variable with specified cutpoints.

##### 1.3 Test

Providing results of a collection of **weighted logrank tests** for
comparing survival distributions for two or more independent groups. For
more information, see
[`survMisc::comp`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/survMisc/versions/0.5.5/topics/comp).

#### 2. Semi-Parametric Methods (Cox Proportional Hazard Model)

##### 2.1 Model Results

Providing a summary table of coefficient and hazard ratio estimates,
standard errors, etc. Log-likelihood and AIC will also be calculated and they can be used for model selection.

##### 2.2 Model Diagnosis

Graphically diagnosing the overall fit and proportional hazard (PH)
assumptions of the cox proportional hazard model.

#### 3. Parametric Methods

##### 3.1 Model Results

Calculating coefficients, acceleration factors and hazard ratios of
exponential and weibull model. Also providing information for model
comparison.

##### 3.2 Model Diagnosis

Graphically diagnosing the distributional assumptions of the parametric models.
